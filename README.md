**Game Template** is all necessary stuff taken care for Godot users not to worry about creating most boring and tedious work.  
Main branch will be compatible with pixel art games, since those games require some more work to get everything right.  
I'd be happy for any contribution to make this template as good as it can be and it is open for branching out Hi-Res game branch.

Template has main scene that's managing:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scene transitioning - during that background loading is taking care of the next scene loading for smooth experience.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HUDLayer - reserved for game specific overlay (HP, Points, etc.)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PauseLayer - Is a menu that appears while in game and pauses the game, allowing to (Resume, Options, Main Menu, Exit).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MainOptions - GUI for changing resolution (Fullscreen, Borderless, scaling), Audio faders (Master, Music, SFX) and Controls section for Action bindings.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FadeLayer - As template it's just Fade-to-Black ColorRect but it's easy to add fading shader to it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music - Persistent AudioStreamPlayer for music  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds - Persistent AudioStreamPlayer for Sounds (initially for GUI)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTMLfocus - if game is HTML5 it will overlay a button on screen, requesting player to click on it and allowing the game to become in focus.  

## Options menu  
Every option get saved uppon exiting Options menu.

## Languages menu  
At the moment simplified interaction. Need someone help with French, Spanish localization (at the moment it's just Google translated).
Russian is translated but excluded in options because font doesn't support Cyrillic letters (If you know good pixel art font with Cyrillic supporl, please let me know).

## Key action binding menu  
Godot editor InputMap influenced rebinding, but with auto-detect function.  
Buttons gets saved uppon exiting Options menu.

## To-Do
* Add pixel-art compliant slider in Action rebinding list
* Action list browsing using ui_directions (ruler doesn't respond)
* Use themes instead of CustomStyle (maybe)
* Maybe some documentation
